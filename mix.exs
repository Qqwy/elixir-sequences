  defp description do
    """
  The Sequences module defines multiple methods that return a Stream of numbers, usually integers.
  
  The different Streams can be tapped in on-demand, by running any `Enum` function on them.

  For efficiency, these sequences are calculated in a way that re-uses previously calculated results whenever possible.


  List of included sequences:

  • Sequences.integers(start, step): a helper function to create any kind of lazy integer sequence with a regular step distance.
  • Sequences.integers
  • Sequences.positive_integers 
  • Sequences.odd_integers
  • Sequences.even_integers
  • Sequences.zeroes
  • Sequences.ones
  • Sequences.factorials
  • Sequences.fibonacci
  • Sequences.catalan
  • Sequences.triangular
  • Sequences.primes
  • Sequences.squareroot_tuple(n): Returns a tuple with an integer part (single integer number) and decimal part (digit stream)
  • Sequences.squareroot_tuple(n, num_of_digits): Returns a tuple with an integer part (single integer number) and decimal part (digit list with given length)
  • Sequences.squareroot_decimals(n): Returns decimal stream of the decimal expansion of a square root.
  • Sequences.squareroot_expansion/1: Returns a digit stream of the decimal expansion of a square root, including the digits of the integral part at the front.
