  Takes elements from the given `collection_of_numbers` while the items in the collection are smaller than the square root of the given `max`.

  It expects the collection_of_numbers to be in ascending format.

  ## Examples:

  Returns `true` if *num* is divisible by any element in *list* (otherwise `false`).
  Stops evaluating the list as soon as a match is found.
