defmodule Sequences.Primes do

  @doc """
  Defines an ascending integer Stream, containing the Prime numbers (A000040).

  This function uses Trial Division to calculate primes;
  For increased efficiency, only earlier-calculated primes are tested for divisibility.

  Runs in O(n*sqrt(n)/ln(n)Â²)

  
  ## Examples:

      iex> Sequences.Primes.trial_division |> Enum.take(10)
      [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]

    # Test each of them by trial-dividing them against already-known prime numbers that are lower than itself.
    # This transforms the list of odd numbers into a list of lists, where each sublist is a list of prime numbers <= to the odd number, in descending order.
